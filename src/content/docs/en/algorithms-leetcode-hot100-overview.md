This series focuses on **LeetCode Hot 100**.  
The goal is *not* to dump 100 isolated solutions, but to help you:

- Build a **mental map** of what each problem is really testing (data structures & patterns).
- Design a **learning path** from easy to hard while covering each key topic.
- Understand **why** a certain Java solution works, instead of memorizing templates.

## Suggested order by topic

Instead of solving problems in numeric order, group them by topic:

1. **Basic data structures / stack / queue**
   - Valid Parentheses (the first example in this series)
   - Min Stack, Implement Queue using Stacks, etc.
2. **Hash table & set**
   - Two Sum, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, etc.
3. **Two pointers & sliding window**
   - Container With Most Water, 3Sum, Sliding Window Maximum, etc.
4. **Linked list**
   - Reverse Linked List, Linked List Cycle, Add Two Numbers, etc.
5. **Trees / binary trees**
   - Binary Tree Level Order Traversal, Symmetric Tree, Maximum Depth of Binary Tree, etc.
6. **Backtracking & search**
   - Permutations, Combination Sum, Subsets, etc.
7. **Dynamic programming**
   - House Robber, Longest Increasing Subsequence, Edit Distance, etc.

Think of Hot 100 as a curated pool, and use **topic-based blocks + difficulty ramps** to get the most out of it.

## How this documentation is structured

Under the small category **“Algorithms / LeetCode hot100”**:

- **This overview page**:
  - Explains the overall roadmap and how problems are grouped.
  - Its `summary` is used for the “Algorithms” card on the docs home page.
- **Each individual problem page** (e.g. 020 - Valid Parentheses):
  - Focuses on one problem: statement, key idea, and Java implementation.
  - When you open any problem, the left sidebar will list all problems under the same `topic` (`LeetCode hot100`), so you can navigate within the series.

So:

- To see “how to approach the whole Hot 100 set” → read this overview.
- To dive into a particular problem → use the sidebar under the `LeetCode hot100` topic.

## Mapping to the Chinese version

For bilingual readers, this series is maintained in both languages:

- Chinese: `section: "算法"`, `topic: "LeetCode hot100"`.
- English: `section: "Algorithms"`, `topic: "LeetCode hot100"`.

Switching between `/zh/docs/` and `/en/docs/` will keep the same overall structure, with explanations localized.
