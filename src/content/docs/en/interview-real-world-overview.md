This series focuses on **real Java interview questions**, not copy‑pasted question banks:

- Questions are taken from actual interviews (campus hiring / experienced hiring / referrals) with the original wording preserved where possible.
- For each question we aim to provide:
  - **The original prompt**, including common follow‑ups from interviewers.
  - **What is really being tested**: JVM, collections, concurrency, database design, or engineering practice.
  - **A structured answer strategy**: start with the core idea, then layer in more details as if answering follow‑up questions.
- It is especially useful for **post‑interview review** and **pre‑interview sprint**.

Under this small category we’ll later add themed problem sets, for example:

- JVM and memory model questions from real interviews.
- Collections / concurrency / locking deep‑dive questions.
- Database / transactions / indexing / schema design questions.

Think of this series as a **review handbook** for interviews:  
start from this overview to understand the structure, then read the detailed question breakdowns for the areas you feel least confident about.
