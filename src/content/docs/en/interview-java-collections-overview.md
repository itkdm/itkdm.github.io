This series focuses on **real Java Collections interview questions**. Typical topics include:

- Core differences between `List` / `Set` / `Map` and their common implementations (`ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.)
- How `HashMap` works internally: array + linked list / red–black tree, resize mechanics, load factor, etc.
- Concurrency design in `ConcurrentHashMap`: segment-style locking, CAS, and red–black trees.
- Ordering and sorting: `TreeMap` / `TreeSet` and how they rely on `Comparable` / `Comparator`.
- Thread-safe collections: when (and when not) to use `Collections.synchronizedXxx`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and their trade-offs.

Later, under this **“Java Collections”** mini-category, we’ll expand with themed articles such as:

- A deep dive into `HashMap`: differences between JDK 7 and JDK 8 implementations and common follow-up questions.
- Performance comparisons and design questions: e.g. why choose `ArrayList` instead of `LinkedList` in most cases?
- Pitfalls and best practices when using collections in concurrent scenarios.

For best results, read this together with the **“Real-world interview questions”** overview so you get both a **macro structure** and **topic-level deep dives** for your interview prep.
